1. seq LAST : When only one argument is given then it produces numbers from 1 to LAST in step increment of 1. If the LAST is less than 1, then is produces no output.
2. seq FIRST LAST : When two arguments are given then it produces numbers from FIRST till LAST is step increment of 1. If LAST is less than FIRST, then it produces no output
3. seq FIRST INCREMENT LAST : When three arguments are given then it produces numbers from FIRST till LAST in step of INCREMENT. If LAST is less than FIRST, then it produces no output.
4. seq -f “FORMAT” FIRST INCREMENT LAST : This command is used to generate sequence in a formatted manner. FIRST and INCREMENT are optional.
5. seq -s “STRING” FIRST INCREMENT LAST : This command is uses to STRING to separate numbers. By default this value is equal to "\n". FIRST and INCREMENT are optional.
